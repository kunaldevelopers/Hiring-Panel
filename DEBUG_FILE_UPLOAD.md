# File Upload Debug Information

## Issue Description

User reported error "Resume must be a PDF file" when uploading documents in the application form, but profile update works fine with all file types (PDF, JPG, PNG).

## Analysis Performed

### Backend Validation (`server/routes/applications.js`)

✅ **fileFilter function** - Updated to allow:

- `application/pdf`
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/jpg`
- `image/png`

✅ **Error message** - Updated to: `${file.fieldname} must be a PDF, JPG, or PNG file`

✅ **Multer configuration** - Same upload instance used for both submit and profile update routes

✅ **Error handling** - Enhanced with detailed logging

### Frontend Validation (`client/src/pages/ApplicationForm.jsx`)

✅ **File type validation** - Allows same types as backend:

```javascript
const allowedTypes = [
  "application/pdf",
  "image/jpeg",
  "image/jpg",
  "image/png",
];
```

✅ **HTML accept attributes** - Set to: `.pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png`

✅ **User interface text** - Updated to mention PNG support

## Changes Made

### Backend (`server/routes/applications.js`)

1. **Enhanced fileFilter** with better logging and clearer error messages
2. **Improved error handling** with detailed console logging
3. **Added debug middleware** to log incoming files and request details

### Frontend (`client/src/pages/ApplicationForm.jsx`)

1. **Updated description text** to mention PNG support
2. **Verified file validation logic** matches backend exactly

## Debugging Steps Added

1. **Enhanced console logging** in fileFilter function with emojis for easy identification
2. **Request logging** to see exactly what files are being received
3. **Error details logging** to identify specific multer errors

## Possible Causes of Original Issue

1. **Browser caching** - Old JavaScript files cached in browser
2. **Server not restarted** - Old code still running
3. **Hidden validation** - Some other validation logic not found in code search

## Testing Instructions

1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Try uploading a JPG or PNG file as resume
3. Check server console for detailed logging output
4. If error persists, check exact error message format

## Expected Behavior

- All document fields should accept PDF, JPG, and PNG files
- Error messages should be consistent between application and profile routes
- Console should show detailed file upload attempt logs

## Next Steps

If issue persists after cache clearing:

1. Check browser developer tools for client-side errors
2. Review server console output for specific file rejection reasons
3. Compare exact error message with current code
