# Candidate Delete Functionality Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of single and bulk delete functionality for candidate applications in the admin dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Single Application Delete

- **Location**: Admin Dashboard → Applications Management tab
- **UI**: Delete button in each row's Actions column
- **Functionality**:
  - Allows admin to delete individual candidate applications
  - Shows confirmation modal before deletion
  - Prevents candidate from logging in after deletion
  - Cleans up associated uploaded files

### 2. Bulk Application Delete

- **Location**: Admin Dashboard → Applications Management tab
- **UI**:
  - Checkboxes in each row for selection
  - "Select All" checkbox in table header
  - Bulk actions bar appears when candidates are selected
  - "Delete Selected" button for bulk operations
- **Functionality**:
  - Allows admin to select multiple candidates for deletion
  - Shows confirmation modal with count of selected applications
  - Deletes all selected applications in a single operation
  - Cleans up associated uploaded files for all deleted applications

## User Experience Flow

### Single Delete:

1. Admin clicks "Delete" button next to a candidate
2. Confirmation modal appears with candidate name
3. Admin confirms or cancels the deletion
4. Toast notification confirms successful deletion
5. Table refreshes to show updated data

### Bulk Delete:

1. Admin selects candidates using checkboxes
2. Blue banner appears showing count of selected candidates
3. Admin clicks "Delete Selected" button
4. Confirmation modal appears with count of applications to delete
5. Admin confirms or cancels the bulk deletion
6. Toast notification confirms successful deletion with count
7. Table refreshes and selection is cleared

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (AdminDashboard.jsx)

- **State Management**:

  - `selectedApplications`: Array of selected application IDs
  - `showDeleteModal`: Boolean for single delete modal
  - `showBulkDeleteModal`: Boolean for bulk delete modal
  - `applicationToDelete`: Single application object for deletion

- **UI Components**:
  - Checkboxes in table rows and header
  - Delete buttons in Actions column
  - Bulk actions banner
  - Confirmation modals with warning icons

### Backend (admin.js routes)

- **Single Delete**: `DELETE /api/admin/applications/:id`

  - Deletes application from database
  - Removes associated uploaded files
  - Returns success message

- **Bulk Delete**: `POST /api/admin/applications/bulk-delete`
  - Accepts array of application IDs
  - Deletes multiple applications atomically
  - Removes associated uploaded files for all applications
  - Returns count of deleted applications

### API Integration (api.js)

```javascript
// Single delete
deleteApplication: (id) => api.delete(`/admin/applications/${id}`);

// Bulk delete
bulkDeleteApplications: (ids) =>
  api.post("/admin/applications/bulk-delete", { ids });
```

## Security Features

1. **Admin Authentication**: All delete operations require admin authentication
2. **File Cleanup**: Associated uploaded documents are removed from server
3. **Confirmation Modals**: Prevents accidental deletions
4. **Database Consistency**: Uses proper MongoDB operations for data integrity

## User Impact

- **For Admins**: Clean interface for managing unwanted applications
- **For Candidates**: Deleted candidates cannot log in (application no longer exists)
- **For System**: Proper cleanup prevents orphaned files and database bloat

## Files Modified

### Frontend:

- `client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Added delete UI and functionality
- `client/src/utils/api.js` - Already had delete API endpoints

### Backend:

- `server/routes/admin.js` - Already had delete route implementations
- `server/models/Application.js` - Uses existing model

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single Delete**:

   - Delete a candidate and verify they cannot log in
   - Check that files are removed from uploads folder
   - Verify table updates correctly

2. **Bulk Delete**:

   - Select multiple candidates and delete them
   - Verify all selected candidates are removed
   - Check that file cleanup works for all applications
   - Test with different selection combinations

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Try to delete with no selections (should show error)
   - Test with all candidates selected
   - Verify modal cancellation works properly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Soft Delete**: Option to mark as deleted instead of permanent removal
2. **Delete Audit Log**: Track who deleted which candidates and when
3. **Batch Operations**: Additional bulk operations like status changes
4. **Export Before Delete**: Option to export candidate data before deletion
